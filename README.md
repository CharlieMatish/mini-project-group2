# mini-project-group2
In this project, we received a data frame of Shark Attacks and performed some data cleaning techniques and EDA to make inferences and conclusions about MVP, business risk, and opportunities. 
With this data frame, we decided to focus our analysis on the data of the columns Country, Activity, Sex, and Species. After cleaning, we focus on getting the most frequent values of each category to determine the following hypotheses:
1)Where are the most common shark attacks?
2)What's the most common activity involved in shark attacks?
3)What's the most common attacked gender?
4)What's the most common species attacker?
After collecting all of this data, we decided to develop a product that would be a wetsuit specially designed and implemented with a shark repellent device or biomaterial. We'll target the public of this product based on the findings.
